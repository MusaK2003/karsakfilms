    The Singing Dunes in Kazakhstan are called Aigaikum ("singing sand dune" in Kazakh). The Singing Dunes are the main attraction of the Altyn-Emel National Park, they look like mountains of pure quartz sand without vegetation, with steep slopes. When dry sand moves, the grains of sand rub against each other, which produces a lingering, loud sound, similar to low singing. That is why they were named "Singing Sands". Such a rare natural phenomenon has been noted in only a few places in the world.
